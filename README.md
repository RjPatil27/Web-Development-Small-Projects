## [Project 5 : BlackJack Challenge](https://github.com/RjPatil27/JavaScript/tree/master/Project%205)
Simple Blackjack project to understand JavaScript,HTML and CSS. \
To whom, who don't know Blackjack, Blackjack is a card game. \
In this project, fuctioning of project works as we have to pick a card randomly from deck. \
And we have to add that cards total to near 21. \
Similarly, Computer picks cards and to make his total near 21. \
Whoever has total near 21, wins a game. \
\
Here we are three option, 
* Pick : use to pick card from deck. 
* Draw : use to draw round. 
* Reload : Reload the game. 
 
>For example,  
>There are 2 players, User 1 and User 2. \
>Algorithm : \
>i) User 1 selected first card consider here 3 of spades(3 point). \
>ii) User 2 selected first card consider here 7 of hearts(7 point). \
>iii) User 1 selected second card consider here Queen of heart(12 point). \
>iv) User 2 selected second card consider here 10 of diamond(10 points). \
>v) Here User 1 has total 15 point if he selects card which is less than 6 point then it will be perfect score i.e. 21 or near 21. \
   If he selects card which is of more than 6 points then User 1 will lose the game. \
>vi) Similar conditions for User 2 also who has total 17 point. \
>vii) If both player draw their game on current points then as User 2 has higher point i.e 17 than User 1's point i.e. 15, \
     User 2 will win the game.
